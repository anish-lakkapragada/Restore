Invasive species of plant are a potent threat to natural environments, ecosystems, and biodiversity. Unfortunately, due to their neglect in the conservationist movement, plants are disregarded despite making up 57% of endagered organisms in the Untied States. To mitigate this issue and allow anyone to help combat the destruction of our natural environment, we developed this application. The app allows anyone, with real-time live feedback, to accurately detect and identify the top invasive species of plant in the Untied States. With time and effort, together, we can stop the spread of invasive species.
